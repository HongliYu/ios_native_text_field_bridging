# ios_native_text_field_bridging

A bridging demo for iOS native text field "predictive issue" (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/12920)

## Getting Started

As described in the ticket, since the flutter default text field doesn't support the `predictive feature`. In details, after user switches off `predictive` option in system keyboard settings, the words will be heighted but no prompt appears at all. There is no perfect solution yet, so I bring this bridging demo to help the community enrich the knowledge.
